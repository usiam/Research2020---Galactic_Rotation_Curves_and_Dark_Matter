### Galactic Rotation Curves - DESI  
#### Project description  
Using neutral hydrogen detections from the ALFALFA survey and HI-MaNGA project, I will extend our data on the rotation of the MaNGA galaxies beyond their luminous, i.e. visible, extent. This will expand the work done by my advisor Kelly A. Douglass et al., who only measured the rotations out to the visible edge of the galaxies.  Because the density of the dark matter halo increases with radius, since it has to offset the decrease in the density of the visible matter to keep the rotation speed same, this initial study was limited to calculating a lower limit on the dark matter halo mass.  By extending the rotation curves with the neutral hydrogen measurements, my work will be to calculate a more accurate dark matter halo mass and better understand the influence of the void environment on a galaxyâ€™s dark matter content.
